This project is a C program that searches for properties in a given price range and city. The program first defines a struct called Property that stores the address, city, state, and price of a property. It then creates an array of Property objects and initializes it with some sample data.

The main function of the program prompts the user to enter the minimum price, maximum price, city, and state. It then calls the searchProperties() function to search for properties that match the given criteria. The searchProperties() function iterates through the array of properties and prints the address, city, state, and price of any properties that match the criteria.

The project also includes a README.md file that provides more information about the project, including the purpose of the project, the programming language used, and the instructions on how to run the program.

Here are some of the key features of the project:

The program is written in C, a popular programming language that is known for its efficiency and portability.
The program uses a struct to store the data for each property. This makes the code more organized and efficient.
The program uses a function to search for properties that match the given criteria. This makes the code more modular and reusable.
